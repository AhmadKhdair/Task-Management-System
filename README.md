# Task-Management-System
Developed a C-based CLI task manager using a linked-list backlog and a stack for performed tasks to enable O(1) undo. Supports loading tasks.txt, add/delete/search (ID or name), perform/undo, and summary Report.txt. Modular architecture, robust file I/O, defensive checks, and safe dynamic memory.
